1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that might be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will depend on the class and id names defined in the "index.html" file. It will also import the "tailwind.css" file to use the Tailwind CSS framework.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for the Tailwind CSS framework. It will be imported by the "styles.css" file and used to style the DOM elements defined in the "index.html" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are the unique identifiers for the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the "styles.css" file to apply specific styles to the corresponding HTML elements.

2. CSS Class Names: These are the identifiers for groups of styling rules in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. They are used in the "index.html" file to apply the corresponding styles to the HTML elements.

3. CSS Import Statements: The "styles.css" file will have an import statement to include the "tailwind.css" file. This allows the "styles.css" file to use the styling rules defined in the "tailwind.css" file.

4. HTML Link Tags: The "index.html" file will have link tags to include the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This allows the HTML file to use the styling rules defined in these CSS files.
